Re-write this code using good ruby coding conventions, especially, focus on these points :
* naming conventions for variables, constants, class & method names
* indent and inline rules when defining methods and classes
* use of parentheses and spaces

The [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/porecreat/ruby-style-guide/blob/master/README-frFR.md) is a good starting point to learn how to write clean ruby code.
