Write a function `age_in_days(day, month, year)` that returns your age in days, given your day, month, and year of birth. It should work as follows 

* You give your day, month, year of birth as parameters (e.g. you will call the function like => `age_in_days(6, 11, 1985)`).
* The function returns `"you have DD days buddy"`, where `DD` is the number of days in your age.

### Tips
* You can use `Time.now.day`, `Time.now.month`, `Time.now.year` to have today's details. See [Time class](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Time.html)
* Try to figure out how you would do that on a sheet of paper before going into the code.
* Use the interactive ruby console (IRB) to make "live" experiments.
