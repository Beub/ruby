### What's a gem ?
First read these two articles
* this [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5233924/what-is-a-ruby-gem) for the overall definition
* this [rubygems doc](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/) to go into the details

Remember the packages we used from ruby standard library (csv, open-uri..)?
Well, the gem system enables anyone to create similar packages, host them on rubygems.org, and make them accessible for any other ruby developer very easily ! cool, isn't it ?

As you might expect, a gem must then respect a standardize structure. Thanks to these standards, the gem is ready-to-use, but also easy to maintain and version (if the gem evolves). 

As you will see, **when you want to do something in ruby / Rails, and when you have no clues where to start, there's often a gem to do the job !** 

### Cool gem examples
* APIs and parsing : twitter / koala / nokogiri
* Markdown : RedCarpet / GFM
* Blog : jekyll 
* HTML form : SimpleForm

### Make your own blog with jekyll
Use the [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) gem to create your blog.

### Deploy it on Github pages
Now you can really simply push it on [Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually). From now on :
* You don't need some un-customizable tumblr any more :)
* you have your own simple blog, clean and usefull. 
* You can add posts easily (and from the source) using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
* Your can enhance your design in your blog CSS.
* It's deployed on Github pages, you just have to buy a custom domain name if you want, and link it to your Github pages URL.

**For submission, you should show us your blog deployed on the web, and you should have written a first article using markdown on something you learned this week !**
