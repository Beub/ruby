Write a shuffle method that takes an array and returned a totally shuffled version. As always, you'll want to test it, but testing this one is trickier. How can you test to make sure you are getting a perfect shuffle ? What would you even say a perfect shuffle would be ? Now test for it.

## Hints
* You should use ruby `rand` function
* To write your algorithm, you are not authorized to use fancy Array methods like `sort_by` or `shuffle`!

## Write a 1-line function
Once you have written your algorithm all by yourself, rewrite another version with only one line of code, this time using `Array#sort_by` ?
