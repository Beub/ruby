Now it's the time to get familiar with the methods of the [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Enumerable.html) module. The Enumerable module is [mixed-in](http://ruby.about.com/od/beginningruby/a/mixin.htm) in most classes that are indeed enumerable as `String`, `Array`, `Hash`... Don't spend too much time on understanding ruby Mixin (because it's pretty advanced ruby).

Let's just say that these Enumerable methods are very convenient to operate complicated tasks on enumerable objects in really few lines of code.

You have to code each method in the template, so that it returns expected result. We tell you which `Enumerable#method` to use for each case, since we are nice buddies :)
