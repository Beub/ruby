* Choose some `Array` Enumerable method you like (or one you don't know, that's the occasion to learn something !). This method should have a **destructive version** ending with a bang (!), like `map` and `map!` or  `select` and `select!`
* Pick one method different from the one chosen by your pair.
* Try to understand the difference between the original version and the bang-version.

**Now code a program that clearly illustrates this difference**. Then show it to your friend and explain to him what you understood.

You should submit your program which is supposed to illustrate the difference between `chosen_method` and `chosen_method!`
