A very simple exercise to learn how to do looping in ruby.

## Objectives

Write a method in ruby that computes the sum of the integers between a min value and a max value.
Ex: what is the sum of the integers between 1 and 100 ?

Implement the function 2 different iterative ways using a `for` loop and a `while` loop 

## Extra: enhance/refactor
Try to implement the function in a recursive way.
