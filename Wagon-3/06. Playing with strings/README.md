Write a method that determines whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome, that is, it reads the same backwards as forwards, ignoring case, punctuation, and nonword characters. A "nonword character" is defined for our purposes as "a character that Ruby regexps would treat as a nonword character".

## Objectives

## Tips
Methods you might find useful (which you'll have to look up in Ruby documentation, ruby-doc.org) include : `String#downcase, String#gsub, String#reverse`

## Enhance/Refactor
Once you have your code working, consider making it more beautiful by using techniques like method chaining.
