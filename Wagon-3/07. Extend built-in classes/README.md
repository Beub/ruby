* Write a function `factorial( an_integer )` which returns the factorial of this integer. Remember what's a factorial ? 

```
6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1= 720
```

* Now re-write this as a method on the `Integer` class, so that you can call `6.factorial` instead of calling `factorial(6)`. 

## Ask yourself ?

* What's the "philosophical" difference between these two approaches ? what's the philosophy behind OOP ? You should read about [programming paradigms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) to understand such differences.

* It feels that we re-defined the Integer class giving it a poor definition with just one factorial method in it.. What really happened ? Google "ruby open class" to understand what is at stake !

## Extra
Extend the `Array` class adding a shuffle method to it !
