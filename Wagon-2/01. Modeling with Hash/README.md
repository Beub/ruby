Let's say you want to stay fit but keep eating McDonalds... You have the brilliant idea to write a quick function that computes the number of calories in a McDonald meal. We consider the following products (with their respective number of calories).

* Cheese Burger : 290
* Big Mac : 300
* Mc Bacon : 400
* Royal Cheese : 130
* French fries : 130
* Potatoes : 130
* Coca : 160
* Sprite : 170

=> How would you do to write this function `calories_in(burger, side, beverage)` using arrays ? 
Just write the pseudocode for it !
=> What if McDonald launches a new product like "Filet-of-Fish" ? What would you have to do to update your program ? 

Learn about ruby [hash](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Hash.html). They will be your best friends and you'll use them everywhere !How would you re-write your pseudo-code using a hash ? Isn't it more convenient ?

Now let's say we are back in the day and McDonald launches its pre-set meals, like "Happy Meal", "Best Of Big Mac", etc.. How could you use a hash to represent these McDonald sets, and relate them to your product-calory hash.
