def group_anagrams(words)
  # your code here
end

# input:
group_anagrams( ['cars', 'for', 'potatoes', 'racs', 'four','scar', 'creams', 'scream'] )

# output:
# =>  [["cars", "racs", "scar"], ["four"], ["for"], ["potatoes"], ["creams", "scream"]]

# HINT: you can quickly tell if two words are anagrams by sorting their
# letters, keeping in mind that upper vs lowercase doesn't matter
